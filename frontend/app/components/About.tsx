        I’m a backend-focused developer currently interning at PearlThoughts.
        I work with NestJS and relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.
        In my first month, I contributed to the Schedula project, and I’m
        currently working on the 1851 Franchise system, building and
        maintaining scalable backend APIs.
